    <p>
      The FireCast X website integrates machine learning, satellite data, and an
      interactive map to forecast and visualize wildfire activity. Its modular
      design separates the frontend UI, Flask based backend, and multiple
      predictive models to ensure scalability and reliability. Users can change
      between Neural Network, Random Forest, and Logistic Regression models to
      compare forecasts of different models. FireCast X delivers a data driven
      and user-friendly platform for accurate wildfire prediction.

      Our product gives a 3D map of the United States with fire and weather
      layers. Secondly, users can look at a specific area to see which is at
      risk and what fires are currently spreading. A use for this product can
      look like a user wanting to see a risk area to inform the public of a
      threat and potential evacuation.

      InvestiBestie is a user-friendly investment assistant that helps users
      evaluate both real estate and stock options.

    <ul>
      <li>
        For real estate, users can input details about a property, and the app
        provides a risk analysis, indicating whether the investment might be
        high-risk or more secure.
      </li>
      <li>
        For stocks, users can type in the name of a company or a stock symbol,
        and the app performs sentiment analysis by scanning the most recent news
        articles, identifying positive or negative language to determine public
        sentiment. Users can also view the actual news articles to explore
        further.
